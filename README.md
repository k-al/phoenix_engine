# phoenix_engine
Engine for a 2d game

This is a fun project of mine and is not likely to be usebal in near future.
But if you like you can go through it and point out my mistakes and bad practices. I will try to fix these.

One thing to my comments:
  //! something must definitly changed in order to make the programm run as wanted
  
  //? A problem that may occur in further working process
  
  //# A change that can (slightly) increase performance
